# Ping-Pong-Game
Learning coding game in Python following Youtuber Christian Thompson. This is clearly a simpler game compared to the Space Invader. The main thing I learned from this project is that: 1. the concept defining the contour a subject, in order to determine collision. 2. shaping default objects. 3. filling strings with multiple informations.
